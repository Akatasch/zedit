Amulet of Articulation

Mastered in: Skyrim.esm

Zims Immersive Artifacts:
Master versions it has knowledge of:
  - Skyrim.esm

Compare against Skyrim.esm and cache change information relative to Skyrim.esm


--

MLU.esp:
Master versions it has knowledge of:
  - Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch.esp
  - Skyrim.esm

Compare against Skyrim.esm and cache change information relative to Skyrim.esm
THEN: we can ignore any changes performed in the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch UNLESS some kind of special patching rule tells us otherwise.

OMEGA ZIA MLU Patch.esp
Master versions it has knowledge of:
  - Skyrim.esm
  - MLU.esp
  - ZIA_Complete Pack_V4.esp

Because it has knowledge of MLU.esp and ZIA_Complete Pack_V4.esp, we can ignore changes in those overrides UNLESS there is some special patching rule that tells us otherwise.

----

What this means for the data format:

- We only need to track changes relative to the master record.
- When we are merging changes, we need to keep track of which file a change came from.
- When we are merging changes, we can "overwrite" changes when the change we are dealing with comes from an override record in a file that has the file that the change to be overwritten comes from as a master.  => BASED UPON PATCHING RULES!
- The patching rules that can influence this are:
  - Obviously, we completely skip a change if the patching rules say we should skip it
  - If a change which is currently recorded has a priority which is higher than that of the current patching rule, then we do not overwrite

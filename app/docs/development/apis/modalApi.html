<h1>Modal API</h1>

<p>The modal API allows you to open a modal with an arbitrary HTML template and controller at any point in the application's lifecycle via an angular event.</p>

<p>It's always best to <code>$emit</code> events from a child scope.  If you don't have a child scope to emit your event from you can <code>$broadcast</code> it from the <code>$rootScope</code> instead.</p>

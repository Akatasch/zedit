<h3>Namespaces</h3>
<p>All members are top-level in <code>xelib</code>.  This choice was made to simplify and shorten code which calls <code>xelib</code> functions.</p>

<p>Below is an overview of the namespaces in <code>xelib</code>.  You can click on a namespace to view the functions in it.</p>

<h3>Important Concepts</h3>

<h4>Elements</h4>

<p>With xelib and the XEdit framework, everything in plugin files (including the files thesmelves) is an element.  In zEdit's GUI, every row in the tree view and every row in the record view is an element.  Elements can be files, groups, records, structs (a collection of a specific set of elements), arrays (a collection of some number of a single type of element), or values.  Elements always have certain things, such as a name and a value.</p>

<h4>Handles</h4>

<p>xelib uses handles internally, </p>

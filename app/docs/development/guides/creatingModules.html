<p>Below is a guide for creating zEdit modules.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare</h2>
<p>Prepare a development environment for creating your zEdit module.</p>

<ul>
    <li>WebStorm</li>
    <li>Sublime Text</li>
    <li>Atom</li>
    <li>Notepad++</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Design</h2>
<p>Make a plan for what your module will do in plain English.  You can spend as much or as little time on this step as you want.  It is recommended to spend a decent amount of time on design, as it will help you avoid time-consuming problems during the implementation step.</p>

<p>Below are some tips for designing modules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Use <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=top+down+design">top-down design</a>.  Break the task into smaller tasks until each task can be completed in a few lines of code.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">Keep it simple</a>.  If something seems too complicated, it probably is.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Implementation</h2>
<p>Below are some tips for implementing modules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don't repeat yourself</a>.  Use functions and data structures when applicable.  You will produce better, easier to debug code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/80084/is-premature-optimization-really-the-root-of-all-evil">premature optimization</a>.  Code the simplest solution, then optimize as necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't be afraid to <a href="docs://Community">ask for help</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Testing and Optimization</h2>

<p>The load order modal allows you to select an order of plugins to load.  It appears automatically when you press the <b>Start Session</b> button on the <a href="docs://Views/Start View">Start View</a>.</p>

<p>The load order modal cannot be closed.  This is because opening it requires setting the game mode and initializing definitions in XEditLib, which currently cannot be undone.</p>

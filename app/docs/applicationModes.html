<p>zEdit will soon offer a variety of application modes other than the currently included "Edit" mode.  Application modes will allow zEdit to offer smooth and complete user experiences for use cases other than viewing/editing plugin files.</p>

<p>All application modes will be accessible from the <a href="docs://Views/Start">Start View</a>.  zEdit will likely be renamed once it includes more application modes than just "Edit".  The currently planned name is "zTools".</p>

<p>Currently planned/implemented application modes include:</p>
